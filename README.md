# CCBuilder 2
### An interactive web app for atomistic modelling of coiled coils and collagens
### Version 2.0.5 (22nd Nov, 2023)

This repository contains the source code for CCBuilder 2. You can access the live
application [here](https://pragmaticproteindesign.bio.ed.ac.uk/builder/).

### Powered by ISAMBARD!
Model building and optimisation in CCBuilder 2.0 is powered by
[ISAMBARD](https://github.com/isambard-uob/isambard). If you'd like to perform model
building on a larger scale, or if you'd like to build more complex models of coiled
coils, collagens or other parameterisable protein folds, you can use ISAMBARD directly
on you local computing resource. A range of [documentation and tutorial
material](https://isambard-uob.github.io/isambard/index.html) is availble to help you
get started.
