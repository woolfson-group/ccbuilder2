This repository contains the source code for CCBuilder 2. You can access the live application [here](http://coiledcoils.chm.bris.ac.uk/ccbuilder2). It is recommended that you use this version of CCBuilder, but if you do require the previous version, it is still available [here](http://rainbow2.chm.bris.ac.uk/app/cc_builder/).

### Powered by ISAMBARD!
Model building and optimisation in CCBuilder 2.0 is powered by [ISAMBARD](https://github.com/woolfson-group/isambard). If you'd like to perform model building on a larger scale, or if you'd like to build more complex models of coiled coils, collagens or other parameterisable protein folds, you can use ISAMBARD directly on you local computing resources. A range of [documentation and tutorial material](https://woolfson-group.github.io/isambard/index.html) is availble to help you get started.
